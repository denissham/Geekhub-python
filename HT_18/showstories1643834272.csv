The reason I’m posting is that I thought I’d write about the product I’ve been building, in hopes it resonates with people.<p>Why build yet another social app? Because I deleted almost all social media around 3&#x2F;4 years ago as it was just net negative on my life. There was very little that was truly interesting, I didn’t care about looking good to other people and because of the ‘media’ and ads, the apps were all designed to make me spend too much time for what I was getting. I hated it and what it meant for people’s behaviour, including mine and my friends.<p>I also noticed that the vast majority of my friends were pretty much passive on the services, even if they had an account. Turns out that most people felt uncomfortable sharing to people they didn’t know too well, which inevitably happens as you meet new people, add them, and often don’t develop the relationship much further. I had a sense that there could be a better way.<p>In that, I remembered the days of Path and Google+ which had the model of focusing on particular people in your network, both through the feed and in how you shared. Path in particular was a ‘real life’ social network, something that despite being brought to market in 2010 or whatever, seemed to be more relevant today.<p>So problem found, problem solved. I took the journey of learning how to code when COVID hit (I was working in Architecture and Design and was about to start my masters degree at Harvard GSD in Boston), then one thing led to another, my prototype garnered some investment interest, and Circles was born.<p>The idea is very much like the name suggests, it’s about adding your contacts (synced through your phonebook) into Circles that define what the relationship is. This means that you only see things from people you have tagged (rather than everyone) and when you share, you choose exactly who it goes to (rather than all your friends or followers).<p>It also takes cues from other privacy focused social products. Posts are encrypted, reactions and comments are only shown to people who are contacts with eachother, and user profiles only show that which has been explicitly shared to the user viewing the profile.<p>As they were mentioned briefly before, it’s essentially a crossover between Path and Google+ with a wrap around layer of privacy, so the potential revenue has to eventually come through paid features rather than ads.<p>We’re in the app store and google play store (yay, cross-platform JS frameworks), the invite code is ‘FULLCIRCLE’ and download links are below:<p>Landing: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oncircles.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oncircles.com</a><p>iOS: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;circles-share-more-with-less&#x2F;id1532621483"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;circles-share-more-with-less&#x2F;i...</a><p>Android: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.oncircles"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.oncircles</a><p>I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on the idea.

kavehkhorram,0,30183465,,2,"Hey HN: Kaveh here, the founder of www.usage.ai<p>We help companies drive down AWS EC2 spend. Why? Because the way it&#x27;s done now is a pain. DevOps and Software Engineers end up spending time managing costs rather than focusing on business problems.<p>Previous to founding Usage, I worked on high-performance computing research at JP Morgan Chase and as a software engineer at a number of smaller startups.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: We are typically brought in by a DevOps manager to cut AWS EC2 costs. The app is entirely self-service and the savings are generated automatically, typically we do this live on a call. On average, we reduce AWS EC2 spend by 50% for 5 minutes of work.<p>To reduce by 50%+, we don&#x27;t touch the instances, require any code change, or change the performance of your instances. We buy Reserved Instances on your behalf (a billing layer change only) and bundle them with guaranteed buyback. So you get the steep 57% savings of 3-year no-upfront RIs with none of the commitment (you can sell them back to us anytime after 30 days).<p>We make money off of a 20% Savings Fee. Happy to chat directly kaveh@usage.ai<p>Have you experienced any issues with managing your company or organization&#x27;s AWS expenses?

We&#x27;re looking for feedback from parents.<p>We&#x27;re 2 dads who started working on Dadditude in the midst of covid lockdowns last year.<p>Being a dad can be a long, emotional, draining, and lonely journey. Through our research we learned that dads want to improve their parenting but are too shy to ask for help, and are tired of reading content online written for mums. We set out to fix that and create a platform that would help dads feel seen, validated, and supported.
By helping dads, we hope to support moms and partners too, because all parents deserve more support.<p>Quick timeline so far:
We started a community of dads on Instagram last Feb to test hypothesis and learn about their needs. We then launched an MVP in April, a super simple app serving weekly coaching guides created with a parenting professional partner.
We made several updates in summer and fall, working like crazy in the background to convince parenting professionals to write coaching guides for us. Especially hard when you&#x27;re a nobody. But people are kind and we found all the support we needed.
We launched a v1 app mid-December with 50 coaching guides and a more full fledge community board (and a paid membership tier).
We&#x27;ve just added on-demand parenting professional support in Jan.
And last week added a picture board for dads to upload pics of their families, and that&#x27;s become more popular than the forums!! ← I knew dads wanted to feel more visible but  I love these discoveries!<p>Super proud of the work done so far, but still so much to do to smooth out the product experience, and get closer to PFM.

I have formed this habit of writing my goals as affirmations in a pocket diary and reading it every morning. However, there are days when I forget to do it and then lose momentum.<p>So, I thought of a chrome extension with a minimal interface where I can add all my affirmations, and then it displays them on a new tab throughout the day, one affirmation at a time.<p>With the help of my teammate, I have created exactly this. It&#x27;s called &#x27;Affirmations Flow.&#x27;<p>This is how it works:<p>- When you add it to the chrome, it comes with a few sample affirmations preloaded
- You can edit and replace them with your affirmations.
- Click save, and you are set.
- When you open a new tab next time, it will shuffle play those affirmations displaying each affirmation for thirty minutes so that you can focus on it.
- If you are in public place and do not want others to see your affirmations, there is an option to hide the shuffle and the extension gives you a blank screen new tab with beautiful floating bubbles.<p>It&#x27;s totally free.<p>Here is the link if you want try it out:

I am excited to launch our Natural Language Processing(NLP) API service with the HN community.<p>Our motto is &#x27;NLP for the masses&#x27;. As you all know NLP requires specialized developers to build language based apps. We usually talk about training models and picking the right algorithm for an NLP task like for example Sentiment Analysis. This may be daunting for non-NLP developers if they are not well versed with the subject.<p>Any developer with an idea related to any app which requires text or speech processing should be able to develop that idea into reality. We at FirstLanguage enable that by providing an easy to use API at an affordable cost for a wide range of NLP tasks.<p>We cater to basic building block tasks like Stemming, Lemmatizer, Morphological Analyzer, POStag etc to advanced tasks like Sentiment Analysis or classification, Question Answering, Translation, Summarization etc.<p>We provide a Free plan to try our API or build your prototype, no credit card required. It is free for life until you decide to upgrade.<p>We provide API documentation which explains each and every API and what it does and how to use it. The documentation page also provides Try It feature which you can use to try our APIs directly in the browser.
