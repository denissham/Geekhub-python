30077510,,story,vsroy,1643142131,"I&#x27;m a student majoring in computer science.
I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to do this summer.<p>I&#x27;ve already ruled out internships at most tech companies b&#x2F;c<p>1. I spent a gap year working at a wide range of companies (big company, startup, research lab)<p>2. I&#x27;m a reasonably good programmer with open-source projects and while I&#x27;m quite sure I have a lot lot more to learn, I don&#x27;t think a tech internship is the highest-leverage use of my time<p>3. (most important reason) I&#x27;m not sure I want to be a SWE. I love software engineering &#x2F; programming, but when I think of the way to make the <i>most</i> impact in the world it&#x27;s probably creating a (actually meaningful) startup&#x2F;organization. (I know, I know, every young person says this these days)<p>Given that this is the case, I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to do this summer besides a normal tech internship. I was contemplating how to figure out  what to do and decided on a &quot;meta-strategy&quot; of consulting people with more experience on forums such as HN.<p>Here are the options I&#x27;ve come up with so far:<p>1. Try to understand virality -- I&#x27;m not particularly good at creating viral content or content that appeals to the masses (aside from the natural edge that comes from being young), which could certainly be useful when marketing a product. An option here is trying to intern at a company like Buzzfeed which is full of people who understand emotions &#x2F; virality.<p>2. Try to understand soft skills &#x2F; business -- There are roles out there like &quot;business development intern&quot;. I don&#x27;t know anything about &quot;business development&quot; but negotiating with other companies &#x2F; writing white-papers &#x2F; etc. could be a useful skill<p>3. Spend time learning on my own. To enact change these days, it&#x27;s probably not sufficient to just know programming (unless you want to do a SASS). Spending time on my own learning physics&#x2F;chemistry&#x2F;biology could be useful. The issue here is I believe mentorship is useful and this option negates that completely.<p>4. Working on my own business (not a software project). I&#x27;ve done this in the past &amp; learned a lot about how to be scrappy. Not a terrible idea, but I don&#x27;t want to sink 3 months into something only to have to return to school. Also negates mentorship. Also I&#x27;d rather spend time learning right now so I can execute on something that&#x27;s not a local maximum of what my brain can imagine right now.",,,,"[30078024, 30077883, 30077644]",,4,Ask HN: What should a student who is already decent at SWE do over the summer?,,5

So you can move up by aiming up or by actually lifting the phone higher.<p>- Joypad x axis strafes.<p>- If you lose track of the helicopter, a blue arrow will appear after about 5 seconds.<p>- Blow up enemies and try to stay alive :)<p>How it works under the hood:<p>- Loads of JavaScript. Lenses are surprisingly programmer-friendly. As a non-artist, this is great. Almost everything can be driven completely by code, although most creators opt to use pre-made components with minimal scripting.<p>- The game uses a custom physics engine with OBB-based collision detections that I wrote from scratch. Snap now has integrated physics that seem to be based on PhysX (i.e., the same as Unity&#x27;s) but this was released well into my development process after I had already rolled my own.<p>- I opted not to use environmental mesh reconstruction because it is performance intensive and gives dubious results on lower-end phones. When I started development, it was only enabled for Lidar-based phones but is since available everywhere.<p>- I instead detect horizontal planes using an API that Snap hasn&#x27;t really documented. I found a snippet of code in their API docs and opened up the Lens Studio .exe to find the names of the other plane events I needed.<p>- Planes are used to create collision boxes that extend to the floor so the helicopter can bump into furniture.<p>- AI-controlled enemy helicopters plot routes using a heightmap generated from the plane data to avoid colliding with obstacles when possible.<p>Takeaways:<p>- This has arguably become my favorite AR prototyping platform. Much faster idea-to-PoC iteration time than anything else out there.<p>- The platform is surprisingly full-featured.<p>- The Lens Studio Editor is remarkably polished and, despite some bugs here and there, is very stable.<p>- The deployment story is second to none. Deploying to the phone involves a single click and is done over the Internet (no need for any tethering or wireless pairing).<p>- Debugging on-device is still challenging (all you can do is log a few lines) but I was assured that an actual debugger is coming soon.<p>- Economic viability: unfortunately, it is not really possible to directly monetize lenses. Most creators contract with brands to create branded lenses.<p>Future plans:<p>- I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping an eye on Snap&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>- No plans for any more full-fledged lenses but I do have some ideas for prototypes I&#x27;d like to try in anticipation of commercially viable mixed reality HMDs hitting the market soon (e.g., Meta&#x27;s Project Cambria).<p>- I may update the game with a tutorial mode and a co-located multiplayer mode (co-op play or PvP) provided I get the necessary support from the Snap dev team.<p>Hope you enjoy and are inspired to dive into AR if you haven&#x27;t already :D",,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_1dJ_x7vXw,2,Show HN: A full AR helicopter action game built as a Snap lens,,0

</code></pre>
In a single statement we are 1) reading a CSV (of purchases) with automatic header detection, dialect detection, type inference and casting, 2) filtering out records that do not belong to the IT department or do not have a purchase timestamp 3) summing the total purchases and grouping by how many days ago they happened, 4) sorting from the most to the least recent day and 5) writing the result in JSON format. All this without loading the full dataset into memory.<p>The Readme is loaded with recipes and there is also a demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;danielcmoura&#x2F;spyqldemo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;danielcmoura&#x2F;spyqldemo</a><p>Any feedback is welcomed!

It&#x27;s a unique blend of spatial puzzle and word puzzle. With the current Wordle craze we realized we could make a web-playable version with Wordle-style emoji sharing etc, so that&#x27;s what we did.<p>We obviously don&#x27;t expect it to be anywhere near as popular as Wordle, but hopefully people enjoy the spatial puzzle aspect of it. We aren&#x27;t worried about making money, it&#x27;s just a fun way to get more people to play our game.<p>As far as tech goes, the original game was made in Unity, but we decided to make this version using Pixi.js to cut down on load times. We do some interesting stuff to pre-generate puzzles (using dancing links&#x2F;algorithm x), which we can talk about if there are questions about it.",,,,,https://sidewords.ca,2,Show HN: We made a playable web version of our word puzzle game,,0

30072348,,story,raju,1643122235,"Hello everyone!<p>In 2020 I was approached by O&#x27;Reilly (I am one of the instructors on their online platform) to see if I wanted to work on a book on Git. And not just any book, a Head First book.<p>I have always been a huge fan of Git, and have been using it since 2009. I regularly teach Git at conferences, online platforms like O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s, and the occasional corporate training gig. So I figured, why not?<p>For those who are familiar with the Head First series, Head First Git is one of the first with a newer and more contemporary L&amp;F. Gone are the stock photos—rather almost all images in the book are illustrations (done by someone at O&#x27;Reilly).  Also, my book uses a very diverse set of characters in every chapter—we have Sangita, Brigitte, Trinity, Armstrong, Gitanjali and Aref and a few others who&#x27;ll join you on your trip as you learn Git.<p>For those NOT familiar with the Head First series, IMO it is a truly unique approach to teaching ideas. It uses a very conversational style, with light-hearted narratives woven through every chapter to teach ideas concretely. The books use a variety of techniques to help truly cement ideas—there is a lot of repetition, dozens of hands-on exercises, and lot of quizzes—even crossword puzzles. AFAIK Head First is truly a class of books on its own, though Manning&#x27;s &quot;grokking&quot; series is one that comes to mind that is attempting to do something similar (and doing so very well).<p>As for the intended audience, I am thinking most HN&#x27;ers are NOT the target audience. This book is directed towards folks very new to Git, and the hope is get them to 80% of what they need to know to use Git effectively.<p>My approach in writing this book (despite it targeting beginners) was not only to teach _how_ to use Git, but also _what_ happens when you do things to Git&#x27;s DAG and the working directory&#x2F;index&#x2F;object datastore. The book uses a LOT of visualizations to explain what happens when you add and commit your work, and how operations like merging, reverting&#x2F;reseting affect the DAG.<p>The book is done, available on O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s platform if you have an account and now on Amazon.  I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback if you decide to take a look at it. My email is raju.gandhi @ the biggest search engine company in the word and my twitter is <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;looselytyped"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;looselytyped</a> (DM&#x27;s are open), LinkedIn is <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;rajugandhi&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;rajugandhi&#x2F;</a><p>This is my second book (first one is from Apress) so if anyone here is interested in knowing what it takes to write a book, or in particular a Head First book, I&#x27;d happy to share everything I&#x27;ve learned. Feel free to post a comment here, or email&#x2F;@ me on Twitter or LinkedIn.<p>Finally, a shout out to the awesome community that is Hacker News. I saved dozens of insightful comments, tips&#x2F;tricks, articles about Git that showed up here and while many of the advanced tricks did not make it into the book, they certainly made me better at Git. Thanks everyone!<p>In case my site gets hugged to death:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Head-First-Git-Learners-Understanding&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1492092517"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Head-First-Git-Learners-Understanding...</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learning.oreilly.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;view&#x2F;head-first-git&#x2F;9781492092506&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learning.oreilly.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;view&#x2F;head-first-git&#x2F;978...</a>",,,,,https://i-love-git.com/,2,Show HN: I Wrote a Book on Git,,0

30072244,,story,aruntdharan,1643121621,"Hi HN, We&#x27;re Arun, Manish, Abhilash and Franklin from Castled Data (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;castled.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;castled.io</a>). Castled is an open source reverse ETL solution. It helps you to periodically sync the data in your database&#x2F;warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, etc.) into sales, marketing, or support apps (Salesforce, Hubspot, Intercom etc.), or custom software, without needing an engineering team. Here’s a demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;71bf33acbb4a41cab7c96a3460a84e5f"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;71bf33acbb4a41cab7c96a3460a84e5f</a>.<p>On an average, mid-scale organizations use around 40 SaaS apps. These are powerful in functionality, but limited by the quality of the product&#x2F;customer data which is fed into them. The data getting synced into these tools is often incomplete, suffers from quality issues, and requires unreliable and manual imports (e.g. from CSV).<p>Manish and I were founding engineers at Hevodata, an ETL company, when it went from 5 customers to around 300 customers. We started seeing the trend of more and more customers wanting to move the data out of their cloud data warehouse to feed their business tools. We built a prototype to solve this for our users, but when we went deep into their use cases, we found that there were a lot of unsolved problems in this space. We also realized that activating warehouse data reliably for operational purposes was emerging as the next big trend for data-driven companies.<p>We did some research and came across Census&#x2F;Hightouch, which were early-stage Reverse ETL cloud solutions at the time. But from our previous experience working in the ETL space, we believed that any data pipeline solution needs to be open source to cover the long list of connectors that needs to be built. So we set out to build our open source Reverse ETL solution.<p>With Castled, companies can create automated data pipelines to periodically sync the output of a warehouse transformation query or dbt models(on the works) to their sales, marketing, support and notification tools. We fetch only the incremental results by default on every pipeline run, which makes sure that rate limits and other constraints of the destination APIs are not breached. Our users can also set a time schedule to define the frequency of the pipeline run.<p>The technical challenges in building such a tool include: doing CDC (Change Data Capture) from data warehouses which do not provide a typical write ahead log; handling rate limits on destination APIs; handling deduplication of records on destination objects; failure handling and automatic retries. But the biggest challenge is the sheer number of destination app integrations that need to be supported—we are talking about tens of thousands of connectors.<p>Our major differentiator from Census&#x2F;Hightouch is that we are open source. Our users can host Castled in their own private cloud and start operationalizing their data for free. We’ve observed that initially customers are inclined towards buying a cloud solution for their data integration needs. But once they scale up, they realize that their cloud vendor is unable to cope with the increasing number of apps getting used in the organization. They soon start building in-house data pipeline solutions or look for an open-source solution to solve their problems. Being open source, we provide the flexibility for our customers to build their own connectors rather than waiting for cloud vendors to fulfill their connector requests.<p>Compared with open-source alternatives (e.g. Grouparoo), we have built Castled in such a way that our community can build new connectors in a few hours. One example of this is our Castled Form Language (CFL), which helps our users auto generate extremely complex forms on the UI by writing a few Java annotations on the backend. This removes the need for a UI developer to build a new connector.<p>We have our Github repo here : <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;castledio&#x2F;castled"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;castledio&#x2F;castled</a>. For most users, you can spin up the application on your desktop in a few minutes. In case you want a hosted solution, we also have our cloud platform hosted at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;castled.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;castled.io</a>. We have a subscription based hosted cloud solution, which provides more security features like single sign on, authentication, user management, notification, alerts, etc.  you can sign up for and try out the product for free, no credit card required.<p>This is the first time we are trying to build an open-source community around a project and we&#x27;re excited to hear any thoughts, insights, questions, encouragement and concerns in the comments below! Also we will be monitoring the thread over the course of today to answer any questions.
