I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to do this summer.<p>I&#x27;ve already ruled out internships at most tech companies b&#x2F;c<p>1. I spent a gap year working at a wide range of companies (big company, startup, research lab)<p>2. I&#x27;m a reasonably good programmer with open-source projects and while I&#x27;m quite sure I have a lot lot more to learn, I don&#x27;t think a tech internship is the highest-leverage use of my time<p>3. (most important reason) I&#x27;m not sure I want to be a SWE. I love software engineering &#x2F; programming, but when I think of the way to make the <i>most</i> impact in the world it&#x27;s probably creating a (actually meaningful) startup&#x2F;organization. (I know, I know, every young person says this these days)<p>Given that this is the case, I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to do this summer besides a normal tech internship. I was contemplating how to figure out  what to do and decided on a &quot;meta-strategy&quot; of consulting people with more experience on forums such as HN.<p>Here are the options I&#x27;ve come up with so far:<p>1. Try to understand virality -- I&#x27;m not particularly good at creating viral content or content that appeals to the masses (aside from the natural edge that comes from being young), which could certainly be useful when marketing a product. An option here is trying to intern at a company like Buzzfeed which is full of people who understand emotions &#x2F; virality.<p>2. Try to understand soft skills &#x2F; business -- There are roles out there like &quot;business development intern&quot;. I don&#x27;t know anything about &quot;business development&quot; but negotiating with other companies &#x2F; writing white-papers &#x2F; etc. could be a useful skill<p>3. Spend time learning on my own. To enact change these days, it&#x27;s probably not sufficient to just know programming (unless you want to do a SASS). Spending time on my own learning physics&#x2F;chemistry&#x2F;biology could be useful. The issue here is I believe mentorship is useful and this option negates that completely.<p>4. Working on my own business (not a software project). I&#x27;ve done this in the past &amp; learned a lot about how to be scrappy. Not a terrible idea, but I don&#x27;t want to sink 3 months into something only to have to return to school. Also negates mentorship. Also I&#x27;d rather spend time learning right now so I can execute on something that&#x27;s not a local maximum of what my brain can imagine right now.",,,,"[30078492, 30078024, 30078432, 30077644, 30077883]",,4,Ask HN: What should a student who is already decent at SWE do over the summer?,,9

Pffff, an algorithm&#x2F;problem can be such complex in nutshell and decomposing a function solving it will be non-relevant (see any std library of PL). Mutable global state? Pfff, anything in software is based on that, the problem is using it properly in target architecture (ex. in micro-controllers global state usually manages analog&#x2F;digital output, calling a function for this adds memory and time overhead especially in real-time systems). Copy-paste? Pfff, similar code != this code solves the same problem, sometimes it&#x27;s easier to include a change in &quot;copy-paste&quot; code than deciding how to include this in boundaries of &quot;reusable&quot; parts (ex. for the first time there&#x27;re two structures X = (A, B) and Y = (A, B) with similar logic but different domains, and then manager decides to include specific logic for Y working with B data).<p>Now my general principle which distinguishes &quot;good&quot; code from &quot;bad&quot; one, is how good it resembles a model solving given problem.

<i>FWIW, yes, I&#x27;ve read the git internals documentation, and they were helpful but very brief.

How would I append a new line to the end of that file, without actually editing the file directly? Just by creating a new blob, and associating that blob with a tree?<p>Then, imagine if the file began and ended with square brackets, so now to append to this &quot;array&quot; I need to insert at one line minus the end of the file (you can assume the brackets have a new line after&#x2F;before, respectively)<p>The bonus round is taking the same logic from above, but applying it to just arbitrary lines within a file.

30039211,,story,adentral,1642874981,"Hello HN,<p>I felt like I needed to vent somewhere while breaking from my SICP self-study session.<p>Just for some background, I do not have a college degree because I have always felt like the schooling system is not a place for me to thrive. I am 23 now and 3 years ago I have decided to learn programming on my own and I have been working as an iOS Developer for the past 2.5 years. Gradually I have come to realize that whenever I am getting stuck on something, it most likely stems from having no background in CS and having little to no information about how the computer, interpreters, compilers, programming languages etc. work. Neither I am able to solve algorithmic challenges - if I do try to solve them, it takes insane amount of time for me to get some understanding on how to approach the problem. Professionally speaking, while doing day-to-day iOS Dev agenda, no one even expects me to have some profound knowledge of CS concepts, as mostly iOS has been just a bunch of Apple Library calls, some networking and then layout, animations etc.<p>Having being immersed more and more into coding, I really would like to expand my knowledge and understand how the stuff in the background really works. My motivation here is to master this field to at least partly understand what I am doing and why I am doing things and also just out of pure curiosity, and also, frankly, being able to financially provide for my mom, that hasn&#x27;t been as lucky as me to end up in such a privileged position and also for my (possible) future family - spouse, child&#x2F;ren or other people in need. I might be wrong here, but I am convinced that having a solid theoretical and practical foundation would make me a better developer, having easier time time to learn other languages and technologies and would make me approach problems in a more efficient manner.<p>After reading through various forums and blogposts I have come across SICP as an important resource  for understanding how interpreters, recursions, and functional languages work among other concepts. I have been going through that book for the past 2 months and currently I am in the middle of the second chapter. During my studying process I have also been watching lectures Berkeley CS61A lectured by Brian Harvey to not rely solely on text. Although I have skipped just several really math heavy exercises and have done the rest of them, learning from this book literally made me cry today. Most of the exercises, even the seemingly easy ones, take me immense amount of time to solve, making me demotivated and full of doubt and leaving me exhausted, in need of taking a day of break to continue further. I generally don&#x27;t think my intelligence (in a sense of the speed of understanding complex concepts) is any good&#x2F;high enough to keep on learning CS&#x2F;programming. Little by little I am starting to doubt my abilities, whether I really should be doing programming, since I have such a hard time understanding things.<p>I do love programming, I do love learning new things and concepts, but I simply feel like I am not the right person to do it because my thinking is just way too slow&#x2F;limited.<p>Having said that, I am genuinely very grateful and very privileged to be in this position, tackling these kind of problems, I do understand majority of the population has not been as lucky as me.<p>Thanks for reading this far and for those who are in a similar situation, I just want to let you know that you are not alone and I really do wish you can get through whatever you are struggling with study&#x2F;work-wise.",,,,"[30040795, 30071485, 30039347, 30042240, 30039437, 30040736, 30039555, 30041188, 30067950, 30039275, 30042663, 30039833, 30039972]",,16,Tell HN: Trying to learn from SICP makes me cry,,17

I’ve always just been in the normal classes because I didn’t want to put in the time when I had other, more genuine interests. And I don’t mean playing video games all day. I mean things like programming and hacking with different electronics.<p>I don’t know very many people that aren’t hell-bent on getting into the best universities. Most of them are taking a significant number of advanced classes (by choice), then going home after school and doing hours and hours of homework, only to get up the very next day and repeat. I constantly wonder where they find the motivation to do this. I’ve talked to a lot of them and many don’t even seem to have any clear motivation except that of getting into the best universities. Maybe it’s not even them but someone else, like their parents.<p>Now I’ve started shifting my focus even further away from school. I’ve got a failing grade in math class, and I’m not even bothered by it. I care about math and believe it is important to solving many real-world problems, but I can’t get myself behind the idea of math class, and school in general. I’d rather learn these things on my own where I can work to apply them to meaningful problems. In other words, there needs to be more of a purpose.<p>So what if there were more opportunities for people who are not having it in high school? By this I mean something similar to a trade school.

We were discussing some issues and wondered, how are the alums and current students of the other Seven Sisters Colleges (Wellesley, Smith, Mt Holyoke, Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Vassar &amp; Radcliffe)on these issues. Came home started a facebook page that grew to 10,000 people in a few weeks. From that, there was a demand, need that people wanted to meet other Seven Sisters, worked with a developer to build this membership website. Its free to join and we have over 10,000 members. Theres a Newsletter, over 70 facebook groups, a 14,000 person job board and in-person&#x2F;virtual events. In totatl, we have over 53,000 people engaging in a part of our network. Overall, there are 250,000 Seven Sisters alums in the world, so there is room to grow &amp; people are graduating from the colleges every year.
