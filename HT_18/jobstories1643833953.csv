Gabriel_h,30180269,1,"Hey HN, I&#x27;m Gabriel, founder of Meticulous.<p>Our mission is to make the world&#x27;s code safe, performant and reliable. We&#x27;re starting with a tool to catch JavaScript regressions in web applications with zero-effort from developers.<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor and Google. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of two.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with mid-to-senior level skill sets. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are driven by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>What you get:<p>Compensation: We want outrageously talented individuals. This means we offer commensurately outrageous equity grants. The equity grant will be 2% or greater (a 2% grant is $600k at last valuation) with employee-friendly terms (10 year exercise window on options). We pay £100k-£150k in base salary, along with top of line benefits and perks. You can read about our values here <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site&#x2F;Meticulous-values-ab2b90d3324447d58f0720481081c9a6"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sumptuous-lungfish-609.notion.site&#x2F;Meticulous-values...</a><p>Learning: You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world&#x27;s leading tech companies).<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub.",1643821237,Meticulous (YC S21) is hiring #2 founding engineer in London,job,
