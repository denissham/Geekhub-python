So why would Microsoft rewrite a Java game in C++ when they literally made C#? C# is cross platform too, and if there weren&#x27;t game libraries already created, they could create them. Microsoft made a key&#x2F;value database in C# that could do like 250 million requests per second. (Proof of concept, but still). This was Microsoft biggest opportunity to promote their own programming language.<p>Microsoft is in big trouble though because Hypixel Minecraft server made something called Hypixel Studios and started the development of a new game called Hytale. And guess what? It&#x27;s written in C#, but the servers are going to be written in Java for some reason. The game is gonna be a Minecraft clone with likely better performance and it will also support scripting, modding etc. out of the box.<p>Long story short, Hytale is aiming to be everything Minecraft is not, and more. They&#x27;re actually going to build a community. I&#x27;m not complaining about Microsoft staying our of the community. Because they did, that&#x27;s probably why we have SpigotMC, Bukkit, Curse, Twitch, Minecraft Forums, Planet Minecraft and so much more, but I still see one of the biggest failed opportunities of all time.<p>Anyways, either Microsoft missed an opportunity or it&#x27;s just the fact that they&#x27;re big tech-- Microsoft bought Minecraft to expand profits, not make it better for players.  Any thoughts?

I applied to this math &amp; CS-program due to my interest in research in computational neuroscience&#x2F;machine learning. Unfortunately, the workload has been very high (60h&#x2F;week inc. lectures) and I feel that I&#x27;m at the brink of a burnout. Simply put, grading here is quite non-lenient and I&#x27;ve lost most of my interest in pure mathematics. Having said this, things will probably become significantly easier and more interesting during the final 2 years of the program as I can specialize in CS&#x2F;machine learning. Finally, while the program is very selective, it’s quite obscure internationally. Combine this with the non-lenient grading and I think I’d be at a major disadvantage applying to US PhD-programs. Basically, I don’t know if this path is realistic for me anymore.
On the other hand, my interest in medicine and neuroscience are significantly higher than pure math, but a little less than machine learning. I’m therefore considering switching to medicine as the workload is significantly lower (40h&#x2F;week inc. lectures) and international reputation being much better (top 10 worldwide). In fact, the medical school is very well known in academic circles, and I could definitely do a PhD in neuroscience here as research is very good. If everything fails, I can still work as a physician which is something I’m interested in too. I do however feel like I’d be wasting my “talents” by going into medical research instead of machine learning.
To conclude, would I be making a good or bad decision by switching to medicine? Although both neuroscience and machine learning are very interesting, I think I prefer the latter and see more potential in it.
